To draw a recognizable picture using circles and squares from PennDraw.java

1. Create a new Java project in your IDE
2. Create two classes: 
DrawShapes.java (main class) and Shape.java (object class)
3. In the Shape class, define the following methods to draw circles and squares:
PennDraw.circle() and PennDraw.square()
PennDraw.java Documentation 
(x and y are coordinates on your window/canvas where it will draw)

4. In the DrawShapes class, create a new instance of Scanner and use it to read user input for shapeâ€™s type, coordinates, and dimensions.
5. Use a loop to repeatedly draw shapes from the user, until they want to quit.
6. For each input, create a new instance of Shape, set its properties using the input values, and call its draw() method 
7. Create a recognizable drawing and have your neighbor guess what is.
